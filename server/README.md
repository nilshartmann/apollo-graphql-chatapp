# GraphQL Tools ChatApp Server Example

## Running the example

* `yarn install`
* `yarn start` (starts with nodemon, so after you change files in `src/` the app automatically is restarted. The server uses `ts-node`, so you dont
  have to compile the sources before starting, they will be compiled at runtime instead)

## Toolchain

* apollo-graphql
* express
* typescript
